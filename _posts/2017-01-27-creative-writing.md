My phone buzzes late at night. 

*Still asleep, strangebird?*

Reading that text unlocks something in me. I am unglued from my body, my fingertips leave the fingertips that are touching the blue screen floating in the dark of my bedroom. I am pushed outside my body, or maybe pushed deeper within, all to make room for a thousand years of old lover's habits that have woken inside me. *Who am I now?*

I think that maybe I'm not even talking to this lonely boy on the other end. There is a weight that moves us, which is beyond our control. Two ghosts that want to meet once again and just using our bodies as vessels. A boy and his strangebird. A strangebird and her boy.
