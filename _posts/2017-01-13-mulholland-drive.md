*Mulholland Drive (2001)* is a movie I liked watching but loved talking about because you can't help learning more about your friends during the discussion. 

First of all, in a movie as long and with as many body doubles as this one, attention to detail is key. Who could follow the reappearances of the multiple svelte blonde types slinking in and out of the frames? Who remembered the order of scenes and how they transition? Movie watching for me hits me at so many sensory levels that I have a hard time enjoying the overall experience for fear of losing out on the tasty details.

I also liked learning who asked about the dropped details or the points in the movie. The human mind's (or at least this human's mind) instict is to remove details that don't fit into the narrative in their head. In a movie like this with its fraying and time-bending threads, there's so much to forget. So, aren't the smartest ones the ones who can reason in all the random scenes with their unconnected cuts, or work out a narrative while simultaneously being able to remember details after they've been discarded as irrelevant from the top level narrative. Of course, as I thought of this theory, I was making sure to be the one to ask about all those details. Maybe it's cheating. Maybe it's Maybelline.
