A video has been circulating the office lately. Simon Sinek, a cool-eyed, well-stubbled gentleman with a look curated to bridge the divide between millenials...and everyone older. (Aside, I appreciate his cool-looking, well-fitting glasses. Not really appreciating how he looks smug no matter what expression he's wearing.)

He actually has a very thoughtful answer to the question of why millenials in the workplace are difficult to manage. Essentially, growing up with parents who shielded us from ever feeling disempowered and spending all of our time connected but not invested in a large network of our peers make us bad at delaying gratification, forming relationships romatically and professionally, and having the patience because some things (like work) just take time to get better.

But I'm thinking that most millenials are graduating college now. Sure we're a little impatient, but how much of that is youth and inexperience? I think it'll take way more time than a few years of observation to come up with generalizations on characteristics of us "millenials". All I'm saying is that it's easy to compare youth to age and call it youth. 

Valid? No? [Check his words out for yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hER0Qp6QJNU&t=583s).
