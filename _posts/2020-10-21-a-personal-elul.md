Elul is the twelfth and final month of the Jewish calendar. It's the month of preparation before Rosh Hashanah and the start of the new year. 

The lesson here is that the true start of a fresh start takes a lot of work, and you probably need to start it ahead of time to do it right. It's time to reflect, apologize, forgive, and plan ahead. I'm a little late this year, but this month has been my own personal Elul. Some time away from Seattle and the city, where I can eat meals with my mom and sister, appreciate the women who have helped shape me, and think about who I want to be next.

### Part 1: What I'm thinking about 

As part of my personal Elul, I've been listening to the book _[Untethered Soul](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk)_ by Michael Singer. He has taken a blend of ancient Daoist and Buddhist practices and explicitly contextualized it for modern living. And somehow -- in a way that numerous self-help books, self-love youtube tutorials, and annual goal settings exercises couldn't do -- this book has moved me and helped me transform how I think and my daily habits. While this short book is an unending hit of deep insights (seriously -- it took me more than 2 weeks to finish because of how many breaks I needed to just absorb and process), the biggest lesson I'm taking away from this round of reading is that energy isn't a stagnant pool that is refilled when you sleep and emptied throughout the day. It is a spring bubbling forth from the ground. And the more you narrow the opening to focus the direction of that water, the less comes forth. I have all the energy (and time!) to do everything I want, if I let myself surrender.

I've also been watching a Youtube channel recommended by my sister, [Kara and Nate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw), a completely delightful pair of Nashville-based travel vloggers. Now, I'm not into travel porn -- it seems like unforgivably pure consumption. But, at the start of COVID, Kara and Nate [purchased a renovated Sprinter van]() and started travelling around America. Then, somewhere in the middle of this godforsaken 2020, Nate committed to [2 weeks of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d5zmqYJYJk) [mountain biking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20LYSvpz7GY) [all 560 miles of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkpIq4JaxNs) [the Colorado Trail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHHAMDRraFU) despite having only been biking for 4 times before that! His journey was so inspiring to watch, not just for the amazing physical feats, but for his commitment to cinematography and Kara's dedicated editing that condensed literally hundreds of hours of footage across multiple cameras into a cohesive and emotionally-moving story.

### Part 2: To whom I'm apologizing, and forgiving

Who has done me the greatest harm? Who has been holding me back? Who deserves my apologies and my forgiveness? Well, it's me!

I've been so hard on myself for my whole life. When I was little, I let people set my goals. _If you get this grade, you can go hang with your friends._, _if you go to an Ivy League school, you can start life off on the right foot_. As an adult, I set my own goals. _If you get paid this much, you can feel worthwhile._ _If you lose this much weight, you will be desirable._ _If you have a husband, house, second house, and dogs before you're 30, then you can consider yourself successful._

That's no way to treat myself. If I keep dangling goals and milestones  in front of me like they're keys to a gated Edonic community, I'll never going to be happy! Nothing is ever enough. No wonder I'm so miserable. And everything I'm doing to be happier (setting new milestones, making new plans) just makes it worse! 

So, I'm sorry, Linda. It's been a tough 27 years. Will you forgive me?

I forgive you, Linda! Those 27 years are in the past. What's done is done. Even what isn't done, if you accidentally start making plans again, setting goals as steps on a path to happiness, is OK! It will take another lifetime to undo our bad habits. But each moment is a chance to catch ourselves and start fresh. 

### Part 3: The plan ahead 

1. Be positive. It's funny because a lot of people think that I am generally positive. The reality is that a positive attitude has been a tool for me to move people through tough situations. But it's not a true reflection of what I've been like on the inside. I've saved all my negativity from the day and unleash it on Josh at night. But, like energy, positivity is an unending spring. If I don't block the flow, only more will come out.

2. Temporarily stop making goals. Goals are my mental potato chips, my Twix bars. They're short snacks of dopamine and do nothing for my overal mental health. Now, being able to set goals is really important for living, but I think I need to diet for a bit.

3. Feel bad. Yes! That's right. The path to a deep and unending well of happiness is to address pain head on. I thought being an adult meant never doing the things you didn't want to do and instead doing everything you do want to do, but that doesn't mean you're happy or in control. Rather, it means I am tasked to spend every moment of my life avoiding what I don't want or preventing hypothetical don't-wants from happening to me. But beyond the pain, that's where true maturity and living a full life happen. 

4. Write, write, write. OK, so I will set one goal. I want to write weekly blog posts, to document and clarify my internal dialogue. Everyone thinks they know thmselves, but do I really? I've spent a long time disengaging from my internal voice. Even this post, compared to who I was a week ago, seem like they're from totally different people. I'd like to get to know who I am. People seem to like her. She seems cool. 

Not all posts will be long like this one. This post is a release of the energy I've felt damming up inside me from my time in Boston. It feels good to let it out. And behind that wall is even more energy. It's limitless, it fills the universe, it all springs from me.
