Taking on an exercise from Esther Perel's _How's Work_ podcast, [which is a great listen] (https://howswork.estherperel.com/episodes/episode-7).

_So now I want you to imagine something. We're three years later and I happened to run into you and I see on the street and I'm going, Hey. I've been meaning to ask you all these years, what happened at that time when we met the last time, you were quite stuck and wondering how you were going to extricate yourself and talking about this very powerful image that that shook you even when you talked about the suicide of the soul and that this was really a rescue mission for your own soul. What happened? What did you do?_

Esther: What did you end up doing? What did you create actually?

Linda: I went back to my job at first. I wanted to wait it out at least for a promotion, because I had earned it, and because it was close. Right before the winter holidays, I recieved the title of Senior Product Manager. It was a great present. Then, I took some time off during the holidays to really get started on writing. The first day, I wrote a childrens book, and planned out three more. I wrote over five draft books about the a single community of animals. I also started drawing and painting again over that time. I picked up my pencil and watercolors about a week in, and draw portraits of every animal character in the city. 

After the year started and I went back to work, I decided to give myself the first three months of the year to plan. I wanted to take the 7 books that I had written and actually produce them into books. In March, I sent some of these books off to a literary agent. I didn't hear back for months, but I kept working. I sent copies of all these books to my friends who had children. I sent copies to my mother-in-law, who animated these books using her homemade clay. We starting working on clay-based activity pages at the end of the books. I took a 2-week vacation to my mother-in-law's so that we could really work together on this part and get the books remade with the additional activity pages. On that trip, I set up a website and an Etsy storefront. We started looking for farmers markets and Facebook groups where we could show people our work. 

Esther: Incredible. Do you remember the moment when you knew this is actually going to happen? 

Linda: I think...when I recieved the first order for a set of books and the clay pages from a complete stranger. We packaged the order that night and took it to the post office the next morning. I couldn't believe someone wanted to buy this. 

Esther: What kind of moment was it for you?

Linda: It felt -- after all the work and the pain and the undertainty -- it felt amazing. I knew that no matter what, I wanted to keep trying this. I wanted to write books that little kids would enjoy and then look back to see it had helped them learn about how to treat people or how to think about group organization. I was so frustrated and tired and elated and scared. The night before I quit, I had Fiancee hold me as I cried. The next day, I had my 1:1 with my boss and told her I was leaving. 

Esther: Take another deep breath. What are some of the other things that you had to let go off and things have really moved.

Linda: I had to give up being tired. I had to emotionally distance myself from my day job, and reduce the range of hours I spent in meetings, in order to give myself the breathing room to feel like I could tackle this work in the evenings. It was exhausting, but I no longer felt exhausted. I made sure to eat right, to start exercising, all so that I had renewed energy in the evenings. It was a big change for me, and required me to set some boundaries with Fiancee. But it was a big shift personally that I needed to do in order to let this happen. 

Esther: Beautiful. Okay. Anchor that image in your body and take it with you
