A short post today.Some conversations I've had recently reminded me why it was so hard to remember and internalize economic theory in college. For example, basic free trade theory expertly sidesteps discussing what happens when a nation, or certain segment of a nation, is only good at creating something with limited demand or no demand at all. And maybe that's because this theory orignated from a time where economists never thought of demand drying up, or of the problems populations have pivoting from one industry to another (what happens to all the sheperds when the sheep business moves to New Zealand?). 

A more central pillar in the theory of *laissez-faire* capitalism also seems to have hit a wall in this post-globalization world. As we better understand the complex ecosystem of our world, core economic theory has not accounted for it. For example, in basic supply-demand curves, the measure of marginal cost never factors in cost to the environment, because that is a check that is delivered to multiple companies, or even to future companies. In major economic health indicators--GDP, consumption data, even NDP--ecological costs don't show up anywhere. They're not tied to a particular agent's P&L, so they're simply not counted. Those numbers are hiding somewhere, and we're already getting some bill past due notices. 

Sometimes capitalism seems like a ill-fitting garment carried forward from our past, like the wooden masts of old sea-faring ships before the steam engine. Like a dream from another world.
