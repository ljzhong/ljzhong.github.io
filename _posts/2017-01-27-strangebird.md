My phone buzzes, instantly waking me from a deep sleep. 

*Hey*.

The darkness is a flat frame around the blinding blue light of my screen. I can't even see my fingers as they clutch my phone.

*Still asleep, strangebird?*

Maybe its in the way the screen seemingly hovers in the air. Maybe its in the way the night feels more like a blanket over my head than empty space. But, for a moment, the words transport me out of my childhood bed, out of the room I slept in all those nights of high school.

I am unglued from my body. I am pushed outside myself, or maybe deeper within, all to make room for a thousand years of old lover's habits that have awoken inside me. He sees me. He sees me beyond my 17 years. He's seen the spirit of a love that is tied to the carbon in my bones. Before that moment I've never been seen for a single second of my life.

I think that maybe I'm not even talking to this lonely boy on the other end. His molecules have reached out to my molecules, bypassing our conscious minds altogether. Two ghosts have reunited through using our bodies as vessels. A boy and his strangebird. A strangebird and her boy.
