It's been raining all day--soft, pillowy raindrops that patter softly on our windows. We don't tend to have big rainstorms here. Seattle winters are sad and mellow. 

The dogs sleep like the dead when it rains. Their deep sighs and complete stillness draw out a deep fatigue. Its heavy weight bears my head down onto my pillows. I roll onto my back and stare at the ceiling. _I can't get up._

The days taste like watered down grief. I have lost a year of my life and will lose one more. I am mmourning every friend I have not seen for so long that I don't even think about anymore. I lost my grandma. I am still losing her.

I feel like I'm barely living. I am a ghost, repeating old patterns of life. I wake up, exhausted. I walk and feed the dogs. We go on a walk. At this point its 8AM and I'm ready to go back to bed. At work, I am carried forward by the momentum of pre-scheduled meetings, with key breaks to give my brain a chance to reboot. The breaks are important. At night, I turn off my computer and take the dogs out again. 7-11pm is a blur. Then it's time to sleep again.
