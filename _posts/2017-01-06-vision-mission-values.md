I've never thought about the process of creating a company's vision, mission and values (VMV). At my p;d job, a huge corporate affair, the VMV's were set so high above my paygrade and massaged by so much marketing overthink that I felt they were more about filling up coment on the company home page than actually determining anything about the direction of the company and the kind of work it did. It sort of just sat, calcifying alone in the footer of the "about us" page, a feeble "Look! We have values! We have those things!" screamed out into the emptiness of flat UI and low click thru ratings. 

So, when Startup asked me to run an offsite to determine our company's vision, mission and values (on my first day no less!), I was starting at zero. Thankfully, because of the internet, the bottleneck to learning isn't getting access to information, it's sifting through it. Great that I'd honed my bullshit detector during 4 years of college and a year and a half at my last job. Ready to go.

Ok. So. Enough exposition, here's what I learned:

* We start at the vision. At an early-stage startup, which is what Startup is, this is your everything. The vision is how you win new hires, investors, and keep your team engaged when they see their checks on payday. Your vision is this bright, beautiful statement that summarizes a world that could exist. The edonic future that will change society, address world peace, cure AIDS--only if your company succeeds in its wildest dreams. Take as long as you want with this bit. I want this vision to be so real and rich that learning about it leaves one with the taste of butter and wild honey on the tongue. 

The vision doesn't have to do with the the company's future. It's better if it doesn't. A great vision should look beyond the immediate company and discusses the kinds of relationships people should have with the world, with themselves, with others. 

This vision, once complete, lays the groundwork for everything else. First and foremost, by contrasting the vision with the world today, it helps reveal the problems that exist. Problems are the reasons that our world today isn't the vision that the company is striving towards.

* So with the dream, the present, and the obstacles in between, a mission really discusses how the company is fixing these problems. Ultimately, there may be too many problems standing in between the present a the vision, but a mission statement helps clarify what a company is choosing to work on and what it's not. I recommend the mission be one sentence that describes what the company will do to solve what problem(s). That'll be important later in product development when a company starts thinking about its personas, product use cases and user stories.

* Finally, with a great vision, an idea of how a company gets there, why are we still wasting time on values? Values don't help define the kind of work that a company is doing. But, they help clarify what kind of people the company needs to be in order to be able to execute on the mission to achieve the vision. Sure, some values like embracing learning and celebrating failure are relevant to solving any problem, but there are some values that might be more unique to one company than another (e.g. radical transparency into pricing at Everlane).

Vision, mission, and values are worth thinking about, especially since we hopefully talk them out once and then don't touch them for the next few years or so. For a company finding alignment on what-they-are-all-about, it's an important discussion that starts the wave that drives product forward before showing anything to the first customer.
